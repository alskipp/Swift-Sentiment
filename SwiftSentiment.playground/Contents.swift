# Sentiment analysis using function composition

Below is a rudimentary sentiment analysis implementation.
The algorithm works by comparing each word of a **String** with a **Set** of positive words and a **Set** of negative words.
Each negative word has a value of **-1**, each positive word **+1**.
The final rating of a String is calculated by adding together the value of all the negative and positive words.
As a final touch, an emoji **String** is displayed to represent the sentiment of the input **String**.

The most interesting aspect of the code is the way the algorithm is built up by composing smaller functions together.

**Compose function forwards**

The compose operator takes two functions as arguments (**A -> B**) & (**B -> C**) and returns a function (**A -> C**).
This operator can be used to thread together a chain of functions. In Haskell, function composition is from right to left.
In Swift it seems more natural to compose from left to right, hence the decision to use a chunky **dot** operator with
a right pointing arrow **â€¢>**

### **Implementation**

There are several tasks that need taking care of.
An input **String** needs to have punctuation removed and be converted to lowercase, then split into an **Array** of **Strings**.
The individual words will then each be fed into a rating function, which will accumulate a **Rating** for the entire **String**.

The **positiveWords** & **negativeWords** are loaded from files.
The files can be found in the *Resources* folder the **wordSetFromFile** function is defined in the *Sources* folder.

With all the pieces in place the rating function can now be defined.
Simply compose together the separate functions using the forward compose operator **â€¢>**

Then split the result into an **Array** of words with the **words** function.
Calculate a **Rating** for the **Array** by using **rateWords** with **basicWordRater** as an argument.
Finally, convert the result into a descriptive emoji string using the **ratingDescription** function.

## **Conclusion**

As the final result shows, this isn't the most sophisticated example of a sentiment analysis algorithm.
However the real purpose of this Playground is to demonstrate the following points:

- An algorithm can be broken down into discreet steps.
- Each step can be implemented as a function that takes an argument and returns a value.
- Once all the individual pieces have been implemented, they can be composed together to create the final algorithm.
- The advantage of this approach is that each individual component can be tested separately and can also be reused for other purposes.
